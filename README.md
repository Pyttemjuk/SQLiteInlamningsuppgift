Assignment that had a time limit of 72 hours where the teacher wanted me to create an app that had some real world application and used a SOLLite database. There were strict requirements on how to comment and which layouts and widgets to use. Some were deprecated at that time and there
is a bug that i coudn't fix within the time limit. I do believe the bug is related to the use of deprecated layouts and widgets.

I'm very happy with how it turned out. I had studied basic SQLLite and was comfortable with using it, but my techer decided to throw me a curve ball where in order to 
get a higher grade I needed to incorporate Content Providers. This was harder than I had expected but I managed it within the time limit.
